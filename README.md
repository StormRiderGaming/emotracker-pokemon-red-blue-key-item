# EmoTracker pack for Pokémon Red/Blue Key Item Randomizer
It's exactly what it says. It's an EmoTracker pack with map for
[stump's Pokémon Red/Blue Key Item Randomizer](https://stump.io/itemrando/).

## Requirements
Obviously, you need [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) installed to make any use of this.

## Installation
If you are reading this on GitHub, you only need to download this from here if you want to test the development
version. You can install the latest release from within EmoTracker itself using the built-in package manager.

If you really do want to use this development version, either:

1. clone this repository into your EmoTracker packs directory (defaults to ``My Documents\EmoTracker\packs``), or
2. download the ZIP of this repository and unzip it into the packs directory.

## Usage

This tracker has just one mode, the standard key item and map tracker.

## Bugs? Suggestions?

## Thanks
I don't actually play this rando. I just know how to program things. So thanks to
[AmberCyprian](https://twitch.tv/ambercyprian), [DukeFireBird](https://twitch.tv/dukefirebird), and
[TGH](https://twitch.tv/tgh_sr) for providing knowledge and testing the logic.

Also thanks to Stump [for having excellent code comments](https://github.com/stump/keyrand).

And of course, thanks to [EmoSaru](https://twitch.tv/emosaru) for the amazing platform that is EmoTracker!
